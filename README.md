# DRL-Methods-for-Process-Control

In this work, we explore the applications of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning for Process Control Applications and make a comparative analysis with the existing PID and MPC Controllers on various industrial use cases. In this report, we briefly introduce PID, MPC and DRL (DDPG, TD3 and SAC) Controllers, their governing equations, and their use cases in SISO and MIMO Control Systems.  Additional Algorithms Implemented: NPG, Reinforce, ASAC, TAC, ATAC -Results to be published soon.
