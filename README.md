# DRL-Methods-for-Process-Control

In this work, we explore the applications of Deep Learning and
Reinforcement Learning for Process Control Applications and make a comparative
analysis with the existing PID and MPC Controllers on various industrial use cases.
In this report, we briefly introduce PID, MPC and DRL (DDPG, TD3 and Soft Actor Critic) Controllers, their governing
equations, and their use cases in SISO and MIMO Control Systems.
